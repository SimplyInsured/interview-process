# Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to interview with us at SimplyInsured!  We're excited to get to you know as the process moves along.

All of the questions asked during your time interviewing here shouldn't require any sort of preparation, but there will be one section that requires you have an environment ready and spun up.  They should more closely match your experience and the type of work you should expect to be able to do here at the role.  We look more for how you work through problems and think about the questions offered.  

## Onsite Interview Process

1. <b>Coding</b> [1:1 with an Engineer, 1 hour] <br>
  The coding section will take place over Coderpad, and you are free to use whatever language you feel the most comfortable in.  You're also free to use google or any other resource that you might find useful.  
  The problem that you'll encounter and the code that you'll be asked to write should feel fairly straightforward.  You don't have to memorize and recite patterns or solve any leetcode style algorithms.  You'll be presented with some context around a problem, then be asked to write some code that generates a specific data structure as an output.

2. <b>Pair-Programming</b> [1:1 with an Engineer, 1 hour] <br>
  <b>This section will require some set up before hand on your part.</b> You'll be asked to work on a front-end feature as the driver, so you'll want a front-end environment spun up before-hand.  Feel free to use any of the following framework environments, or any other you might be comfortable with.
    We'll be looking for your ability to work with another engineer to solve/approach problems.
    * React: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
    * Angular: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli

3. <b>Systems Design</b> [1:1 with an Engineer, 1 hour] <br>
  You'll be asked to create a system that solves a core value proposition of SimplyInsured.  You'll be asked questions that will have you think through the data model all the way up to the architecture.  
  
4. <b>Product</b> [1:1 with an Product Manager, 1 hour] <br>
  You'll be given context around an actual SimplyInsured customer feature request, and asked to work through your approach to creating the right product for the customer.  Things we will look into are the ability to think of potential ideas to consider, prioritization, and ensuring that any feature that is recommended has a clear user experience and takes into consideration all the ways in which a user could interact with it.
  
5. <b>Mission</b> [1:1 with the CEO, 15 minutes] <br>
  You'll have a quick chat with our CEO on the mission here at SimplyInsured.
